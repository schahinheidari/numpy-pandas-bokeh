# numpy-pandas-bokeh

### In this repository, I worked on the basic concepts of linear algebra and multi-dimensional space using the `Numpy` and `Pandas` libraries, as well as data display using `matplotlib` and the `Bokeh` library.

## Installation
Provided you already have NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas already installed, the `imutils` package is completely `pip`-installable:

<pre>$ pip install bokeh</pre>

## What is Bokeh library ?
Bokeh is an interactive visualization library for modern web browsers. It provides elegant, concise construction of versatile graphics and affords high-performance interactivity across large or streaming datasets. Bokeh can help anyone who wants to create interactive plots, dashboards, and data applications quickly and easily.
